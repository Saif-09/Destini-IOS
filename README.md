# Destini

## Our Journey

The journey of creating Destini was an educational and inspiring one. Through this project, I delved into implementing the MVC design pattern and honed my skills in structuring Swift code effectively. It was an opportunity to deeply understand the importance of separating the Model from the Controller and ensuring clarity in app architecture.

## What I Created

Destini is more than just an app; it's an immersive "choose your own adventure" game, reminiscent of popular storytelling apps like "Life Line." Users are transported into captivating narratives where their choices shape the course of the story. The app is not just about entertainment; it's about creating an engaging and interactive storytelling experience for the audience.

## Crafting the Story

At the heart of Destini lies a collection of captivating story strings. These strings weave intricate tales, presenting users with dilemmas and choices that lead to diverse outcomes. From a deserted road to a rusty pickup truck, each scenario is meticulously crafted to evoke suspense and excitement. With every decision, users embark on a unique journey, filled with twists and turns.
